# TDD Best Practice

I've been writing TDD (Test-Driven Development) code since my first programming job in 2007 and it changed my development life. It made me a better developer and write better, more thoughtful code. This is not a tutorial on writing TDD so if you haven't done it before then I recommend you search for them before coming to this repository.

In TDD, the principles are you write the test, watch it fail for the right reason, fix it with minimal change.
If your test doesn't fail for the right reason, make sure it does. You don't want to fix a test only for it to still fail and you end up doing more than you should.

I have used C# as my language of choice to demonstrate these best practices but there is no reason why you couldn't apply them in other languages.

### Why would you write code TDD?
You will eventually think how will I test this? I need to keep this simple.

## Best practice

Remember!
- Write the test first.
- Watch it fail for the right reason - if it doesn't, make sure it does.
- A test that does not compile is a failing test.
- Fix the test.
- Refactor if need be.

## Examples
All the examples of best practice are listed below.
